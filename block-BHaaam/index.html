                    <h2>Global Warming and Climate Change </h2>
                    <img src="assets/media/global warming.jpg" alt="Global warming" width="250" height="250" /> 
                    <p>Since its founding, the Pacific Institute has been at the forefront of research on the impacts of climate change on water resources and on strategies to reduce those impacts. The water cycle and the climate cycle are inextricably linked. The movement of water is the primary way that energy is redistributed around the planet. And as temperatures rise, the flows of water in the hydrologic cycle will accelerate. Among other consequences, climate change will intensify the water cycle, altering water availability, timing, quality, and demand. Indeed, all of the major international and national assessments have concluded that freshwater systems are among the most vulnerable sectors of society to climate changes.</p>
                    <p>Early work done by Pacific Institute staff highlighted the risks of climate change for regional water systems, especially those dependent on snowfall and snowpack. As early as the late 1980s and early 1990s, we briefed leading national and international policymakers on climate and water risks. Institute staff played a leading role in evaluating risks to the nation‚Äôs water resources as part of the first U.S. National Assessment.</p>
                    <p>Some degree of climate change is now unavoidable. Thus, adaptation must be a central element of policy. Adaptation refers to initiatives and measures to reduce the vulnerability of natural and human systems to actual and expected climate change effects. Water managers and farmers around the world already implement a variety of technologies and practices to adapt to current climate- and weather-related risks. For example, water managers implement water conservation and efficiency measures to reduce their vulnerability to water supply constraints. Farmers shift the timing and types of crops grown according to seasonal weather forecasts.</p>
                    <h3>Impact of Climate Change</h3>
                    <p>Climate change refers to significant, long-term changes in the global climate.</p>
                    <p>The global climate is the connected system of sun, earth and oceans, wind, rain and snow, forests, deserts and savannas, and everything people do, too. The climate of a place, say New York, can be described as its rainfall, changing temperatures during the year and so on.</p>
                    <p>But the global climate is more than the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù of the climates of specific places.</p>
                    <h3>Steps need to prevent Climate Change</h3>
                    <p>Replacing one regular light bulb with a compact fluorescent light bulb will save 150 pounds of carbon dioxide a year.</p>
                    <p>Walk, bike, carpool or take mass transit more often. You'll save one pound of carbon dioxide for every mile you don't drive!</p>
                    <p>You can save 2,400 pounds of carbon dioxide per year by recycling just half of your household waste.</p>
                    <p>t takes a lot of energy to heat water. Use less hot water by taking shorter and cooler showers and washing your clothes in cold or warm instead of hot water (more than 500 pounds of carbon dioxide saved per year).</p>

<!-- 
### Create a website having 3 separate pages.

#### TODO üíª:

1. Create a multi-page website, having at least three pages connected.

2. Each page must have one header and footer.

3. In between the header and footer, there must be the main content of the page.

4. The main content must have at least two articles.

5. Each article must have one image.

6. Use different background colors for different pages.

7. Using CSS resets is necessary.

- use appropriate semantic tags and keep the nesting and indentation clean. -->
